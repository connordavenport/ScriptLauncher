ScriptLauncher
==============

ScriptLauncher is a tool to quickly find and run scripts based on the script file name. Similar to [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) or OSX's Spotlight Search.

-   ### Scripts/Extensions

    If you use custom locations for Scripts and Extensions, you can set
    the path here.

-   ### Search Near Open Fonts for Scripts

    ScriptLauncher will look for scripts located near your fonts. This
    is helpful if you keep project-based scripts near your fonts. The
    default is to move up 3 directories and start searching from there.
    **CAUTION:** Expanding the search area too much will cause the
    script to run slowly. You might need to fiddle with the Search Up
    setting to find the setting that works best for you.

-   ### Rememember Last Scripts

    The number of script that show up in the window.
